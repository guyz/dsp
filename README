OMAP3 (BeagleBoard) DSP hardware accelerated video decoding library.

Features:

- Supports BeagleBoard OMAP3 processors.
- Based on Codec Engine 3.
- Contains H.264 and MPEG4 implementations. Could easily be extended to other modules.

Notes:
- Code is an extension to the great OMAPFBPLAY code, which is designed for OMAP4 - http://git.mansr.com/?p=omapfbplay.
- Some dependencies may refer to OMAPFBPLAY, but were lost since I originally wrote this module.
